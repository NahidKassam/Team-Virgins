# Team-Virgins
# DBL-Data-Challenge
This Project entails data analysis on a file containing close to 6 million tweets regarding different airlines. 
Our task as a team is to tackle a large, structured dataset by answering specific analysis questions using proposed techniques. We'll identify the right software tools, implement repeatable analyses, and assess the validity and suitability of our approaches. Key elements include handling large data in various formats (files, relational databases, object databases), pre-processing the data for analysis, and storing our results appropriately.
